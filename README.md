Featured Content/Hero Player
====================

A small project that turns all of the slightly different versions of the same featured content/hero player I have made over the years into one "meta-plugin".

To-do
---------------------

- Review and re-write code as necessary
- Add touch (swipe) interaction

- Write documentation
